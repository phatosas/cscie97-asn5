extensions made to existing requiements


made all Spacecraft and Missions fully searchable with a rich Search objects

made discoveries found for Asteroids fully loggable and separate - this way a past history can be created of when/where discoveries were made, in what amounts, etc.

lots of usages of enums in all libraries; better re-use, less error, and also expandable type bases

Missions support n-number of associated Spacrcraft
