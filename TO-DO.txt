Class Dictionaries: a catalog of the classes that collectively comprise the Asteroid Exploration System and the various methods, properties, and attributes that define each class within each sub-system8.	Sequence Diagrams: shows an examples of how users interact with the Command and Control User Interface, and how that sub-system interacts with other sub-systems10.	Implementation Details: special considerations and explanatory observations about how the classes and sub-systems relate to each other and work11.	Changes from Original Design & Requirements: explanations of how this implementation varies slightly from the stated requirements in CSCIE97Assignment5AsteroidExplorationSystemRequirements.pdf12.	Testing: explanation of how the classes in the Asteroid Exploration System may be tested, and explain how an example testing harness would work13.	Risks: identifies and enumerates any potential pitfalls or deficiencies in the current implementation and issues that might arise from this implementation
